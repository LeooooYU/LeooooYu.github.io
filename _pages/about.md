I am currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China supervised by [Associate Professor Weijia Li](https://liweijia.github.io/). My research interests include remote sensing image understanding, computer vision, and deep learning. Prior to this, I received a B.S. degree in geomatics engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2022.
